.. Unbound User Manual master file

.. Warning:: This project has been launched in March 2020 and has the goal to
             replace the `existing documentation
             <https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/>`_ with an
             open source community project. **This is a work in progress.**

Unbound by NLnet Labs
=====================

**Welcome to the Unbound documentation. Unbound is a validating, recursive,
caching DNS resolver. It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern
features based on open standards.**

Unbound runs on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, MacOS, Linux and Microsoft Windows,
with packages available for most platforms. It is included in the base-system of
FreeBSD and OpenBSD and in the standard repositories of most Linux
distributions. Installation and configuration is designed to be easy. Setting up
a resolver for your machine or network can be done with only a few lines of
configuration.

This documentation is an open source project maintained by NLnet Labs. We always
appreciate your feedback and improvements. You can submit an issue or pull
request on the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound-manual/issues>`_, or post a message on the
