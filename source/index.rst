.. Warning:: This project has been launched in March 2020 and has the goal to
             replace the `existing documentation
             <https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/>`_ with an
             open source community project. **This is a work in progress.**

Welcome to the Unbound documentation. Unbound is a validating, recursive,
caching DNS resolver. It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern
features based on open standards.

Unbound is free, open source software under the BSD license. The guiding
principles for our product development roadmap are first and foremost the
security and privacy of the user.

This documentation is an open source project maintained by NLnet Labs. We always
appreciate your feedback and improvements. You can submit an issue or pull
request on the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound-manual/issues>`_, or post a message on the
`Unbound users <https://lists.nlnetlabs.nl/mailman/listinfo/unbound-users>`_.
