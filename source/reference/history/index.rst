History
=======

Unbound started out as a project to develop independent open-source DNS software
and documentation. It was jointly funded by `VeriSign, Inc.
<https://www.verisign.com>`_, and the `University of Southern
California/Information Sciences Institute <http://www.isi.edu>`_. The C
implementation was based on a prototype written in Java. It was released in May
2008 with this :download:`press release<files/Unbound_Press_Release.pdf>`.

This section contains several historic documents. There are also presentations
about the intial Unbound design delivered at :download:`IETF 67
<files/ietf67-design-02.pdf>` and :download:`RIPE 56
<files/ripe56_unbound_02.pdf>`.
